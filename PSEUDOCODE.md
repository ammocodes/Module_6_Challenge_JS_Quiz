## Pseudocode

Create a button linked to a timer.

Link questions to answers.
Add event listeners to the answers, pick one of the questions to go next.

Create an answer checker, if the answer was incorrect, remove time from the clock.

Create a function that checks if all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, if that's the case, end the game.

When the game ends, we display relevant information, prompt giving them the ability to save information in local storage.
